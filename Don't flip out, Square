A square has a quarter in each corner. You are blindfolded and must get all quarters to be heads up or all to be tails up. 
You will be told when you have done this. You may flip however many you want, then ask if you are done (this constitutes a turn). 
The square is then rotated/spun an undisclosed number of times. You then get another turn and so on…

Is there a strategy that is guaranteed to work in a finite number of moves, and if so, what is that smallest number of moves you 
need to be 100% you’ll be able to have all heads up or all tails up?

There are 16 possibilities of 4 coins arranged on the rotating square.
Carefully observing only 6 cases are unique.
H H  T T  T H  T T  T H  H H
H H  T T  H H  H H  H T  T H
1    2    3    4    5    6

The possible moves are 1, 2, 3, 4 coin flips.

Initially we begin with all 4 coins flips. So the cases 1 and 2 are covered.
2nd step we turn any 2 adjacent coins. In case 4 if all coins face the same (flipping bottom 2 or top 2 coins) then the game is over after flipping all the coins in the next turn
else we end up in case 5 (if left coins or right coins are flipped).

Now the cases that remained are T H  T H  H H
                                H H  H T  T H

Now flip diagonally opposite coins.
This cover case 5 (original) after flipping all the coins in the next turn.

Now to deal with T H  H H
                 H H  T H
Flip one coin. Thsi could lead to case 4 or case 5 (original)
To cover this task repeat the steps above.

So the final steps are ALL ADJ ALL OPP ALL ONE ALL ADJ ALL OPP ALL.
